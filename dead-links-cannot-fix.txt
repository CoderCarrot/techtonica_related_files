       ***I reached out to Girl Develop It and they said they are working on fixing the link.***
       ***The material/repo for the link is here: https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-featured-html-css-intermediate, but the link itself has not been fixed yet.
          If I can figure out how they're putting up the other sites, I might be able to help them fix it.***
